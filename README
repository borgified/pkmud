getdb.pl telnets into pkmud, vostats every item in the game. has 2 output files: input and output. loo at input for a log of what went on in the telnet session. this "input" file is for parser.pl.

parser.pl goes through "input" and extracts all vostat data and puts it into a hash. contents of the hash can be printed back out or can be stored into a database for later retrieval.

allobj_db is the all the stuff inside the hash to verify that the vostat data was parsed correctly.

allisf is same as input. had to concatenate two diff runs that yielded two diff input files.
